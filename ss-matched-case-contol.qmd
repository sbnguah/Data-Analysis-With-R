This section uses the formula by @wang2020. This is written below:

$$
n = (\frac{Z_{\alpha/2} + Z_\beta}{P_1 - P_2})^2 \times (1 + \frac{1}{k})
$$

where:

-   $n$ is the number of matched pairs needed
-   $Z_{\alpha/2}$ is the critical value of the standard normal distribution at the desired
    significance level such that a 95% confidence level will correspond to 1.96
-   $Z_{\beta}$ is the critical value of the standard normal distribution at the desired power such
    that an 80% power will correspond to a value of 0.84.
-   $P_1$ is the proportion of exposure in cases
-   $P_0$ is the proportion of exposure in controls
-   $k$ is the number of controls per case such that for a 1:1 match $k$ =1

## Scenario

A researcher intends to conduct a matched case-control study to determine the association between
exposure and an outcome.
